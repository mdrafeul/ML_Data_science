# data_science
This repo contains works regarding some projects on data science on data clustering, topic modeling and others works relate with data analysis like data cleaning, filtering or visualization. Most of work done by using Jupyter Notebook and python. One thing to be noted that sometimes I have sliced dataset into a very tiny portion so that the file size become small and easily view able in github.

At the end my heartful appreciation to visit here.
